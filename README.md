# OO Tic-Tac-Toe

You can play this game by going to [my repl on Replit](https://replit.com/@DuncanBritt/Tic-Tac-Toe#.replit)

Features:
- You can toggle a helper tool which, when used, will show you how to not lose.
- You can change the interface to a num-pad optimized interface.
- You can change the markers on the board from X's and O's to whatever you want, provided they are different.
- You can play with three different difficulty levels, the most difficult of which is impossible to beat. It's implemented using the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
